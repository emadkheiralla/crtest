# Crtest

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.1.2.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Details

I completed the app without the state management requirement due to not having the time to learn and implement NGRX library.
